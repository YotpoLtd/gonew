If you want to add more licence templates or improve existing templates
please [create a new issue][issues]. I'm always open to ideas regarding template
improvement. But be warned that I will scrutenize these ideas and reject some.
The generality of Gonew's templating system allows users to create and use
custom template sets. The guideline for altering Gonew's default templates is
this:

| Content generated by gonew's default templates should follow all commonly
| accepted best-practices for their respective file types.

Any changes to gonew's templates should result in for greater adherence to this
principle.
