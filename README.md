Gonew v2
========

This is gonew v2. It improves on gonew classic by providing a more flexible
configuration and a vastly simpler code base. Users of Gonew classic will need
to translate their existing configurations into the new JSON configuration.
Read [the Configuration section](#Configuration) for more information about
setting up a new Gonew config.

About gonew

Documentation
=============

Prerequisites
-------------

[Install Go][]

Install
-------

    go get github.com/bmatsuo/gonew

Examples
--------

Create a new project "go-mp3".

    $ gonew pkg go-mp3 && ls go-mp3
    LICENSE     README.md   mp3.go      mp3_test.go
    $

While hacking furiously at `mp3.go` (and `mp3_test.go` :p), bust out a new
library, `decode.go`, for modularity.

    $ gonew lib decode mp3 && ls *.go
    LICENSE     README.md   decoder.go  decoder_test.go mp3.go      mp3_test.go
    $

Options
-------

To see command line options, run gonew with the -h flag

    gonew -h

Configuration
-------------

Gonew uses a JSON configuration file. There is an example Gonew configuration
provided for easy pick up. Install the configuration in ~/.config/gonew.json
and customize with your favorite text editor.

    mkdir -p ~/.config
    curl https://raw.github.com/bmatsuo/gonew/v2/gonew.json.example > ~/.config/gonew.json
    vim ~/gonew.json

Checkout [the config package][] for configiration documentation.

Help out
========

If you want to add more licence templates or improve existing templates
please [create a new issue][issues]. I'm always open to ideas regarding template
improvement. But be warned that I will scrutenize these ideas and reject some.
The generality of Gonew's templating system allows users to create and use
custom template sets. The guideline for altering Gonew's default templates is
this:

> Content generated by gonew's default templates should follow all commonly
> accepted best-practices for their respective file types.

Any changes to gonew's templates should result in for greater adherence to this
principle.
